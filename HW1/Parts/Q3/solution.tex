\underline{Theorem}: (Linearity of Expectation)
Let $R_0, R_1, \dots$ be random variables s.t. 
\begin{gather*}
    \sum_\text{i = 0}^\infty \mathbb{E}(|R_i|) \: \text{converges}
\end{gather*}
then
\begin{gather*}
    \mathbb{E}(\sum_\text{i = 0}^\infty R_i) = \sum_\text{i = 0}^\infty \mathbb{E}(R_i)
\end{gather*}


In light of this theorem, an example where $\mathbb{E}(\sum_\text{t = 0}^\infty C_t) \neq \sum_\text{t = 0}^\infty \mathbb{E}(C_t)$
requires $\sum_\text{i = 0}^\infty \mathbb{E}(|R_i|)$ to diverge.

This question illustrates the Gambler's paradox which will be described next. 
\underline{Gambler's Paradox}: Consider of a fair Roulette wheel. The expectation of the sum of your expected wins for each bet is zero ($\mathbb{E}(R_i)=0$)
Therefore,
\begin{gather*}
    \sum_\text{i = 0}^\infty \mathbb{E}(R_i) = 0
\end{gather*}
However, looking at the problem a different way, the probability of winning at least once as the number of spins approaches infinity is obviously one because it is a fair
roulette wheel. Therefore, if a strategy can be devised that gaurentees that if the wheel lands on green and the player wins that the player can end the game and walk away with 
a net gain in money, then $\mathbb{E}(\sum_\text{i = 0}^\infty R_i) > 0$.

A well known strategy to achieve this is called "bet doubling." This strategy involves betting a starting amount, say $10$, and every time the player loses they double their bet. If the player wins they stop
playing and go home. The nth bet is $10 * 2^{n-1}$ whil the probability you make the bet (you haven't won yet) is $2^{-n}$ so $C_n = 10 * 2^{n-1}$
Therefore,
\begin{gather*}
    \mathbb{E}(|C_n|) = 10*2^{n-1}*2^{-n} = 20 \\
    \implies \sum_\text{i = 0}^\infty \mathbb{E}(|C_i|) = 20 + 20 + \dots
\end{gather*}
This means that $\sum_\text{i = 0}^\infty \mathbb{E}(|C_i|)$ diverges so the theorem does not hold so
\begin{gather*}
    \mathbb{E}(\sum_\text{t = 0}^\infty C_t) \neq \sum_\text{t = 0}^\infty \mathbb{E}(C_t)
\end{gather*}
